## What Are Gravitational Waves?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Predicted in **1916** by **Albert Einstein**
- fabric of **spacetime** (4D)
- Mass and energy **curve spacetime** $\to$ gravity

## The Chirp Signal: Blackhole merger

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Detected on **September 14, 2015**
- 36 and 29 solar masses
- $\approx 1.3 \textrm{B ly}$ away
- **2017 Nobel Prize in Physics**
- Increasing frequency, amplitude
- Converted to sound:
  - sound like a bird chirp

## Sensitivity of LIGO

- Measures changes:
  - **10,000 $\times$ smaller than a proton’s diameter** ($10^{-20} m$)
- Equivalent to:
  - Measuring distance to nearest star ($4.2$ ly) w/ precision smaller than a human hair
- Glitches (noise signal)
  - Earthquakes, Traffic vibrations, Thermal vibrations, Quantum laser noise

## Glitch Classification Challenge

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Many glitch sources remain unknown
- Some closely resemble real signals
- Distinguishing signal vs noise is a **classification problem**

## Machine Learning & Classification

- Random forest classifiers @shah2023wavesforestrandomforest
- Image-based classifiers @alvarezlopez2023gspynettreesignalvsglitchclassifiergravitationalwave
- Cross-correlation between detectors
  - LIGO (United States), Virgo (Europe), KAGRA (Japan)
- True GW:
  - Consistent signal in multiple detectors
- Crowd Sourced Project [Gravity Spy](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy)

## Key Takeaways

- Gravitational waves open a new window on the universe
- LIGO measures extraordinarily tiny spacetime distortions
- Noise makes detection a major classification challenge
- Application of machine learning in astrophysics
