## What Are Gravitational Waves?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Predicted in **1916** by **Albert Einstein**
- fabric of **spacetime** (4D)
- Mass and energy **curve spacetime** $\to$ gravity

## Gravitational Waves continued

- Generated by **massive moving objects**
- Propagate at the **speed of light**
- Everyday objects produce waves, but:
  - Effects are **far too small** to detect
- Detectable Source
  - Binary blackholes, neutron stars
  - supernova explosion

---

## Why Gravitational Waves Matter

- Traditional astronomy relies on **electromagnetic radiation**
- Light can be: Absorbed, Scattered, Blocked by dust or gas
- Gravitational waves:
  - Interact extremely weakly with matter
  - Travel largely unimpeded
- Enable observation of:
  - Black hole mergers
  - Otherwise inaccessible regions

---

## How Do We Observe Gravitational Waves?

- Detection is an **extraordinary technological challenge**
- Primary instrument:
  - **LIGO** (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory)

## The Chirp Signal: Blackhole merger

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Detected on **September 14, 2015**
- 36 and 29 solar masses
- $\approx 1.3 \textrm{B ly}$ away
- **2017 Nobel Prize in Physics**
- Increasing frequency, amplitude
- Converted to sound:
  - sound like a bird chirp

## Sensitivity of LIGO

- Measures changes:
  - **10,000 $\times$ smaller than a proton’s diameter**
- Equivalent to:
  - Measuring distance to nearest star
  - With precision smaller than a human hair
- Glitches
  - Earthquakes, Traffic vibrations, Thermal vibrations, Quantum laser noise

## Glitch Classification Challenge

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Many glitch sources remain unknown
- Some closely resemble real signals
- Distinguishing signal vs noise is a **classification problem**

## Machine Learning & Classification

Methods used include:

- Random forest classifiers @shah2023wavesforestrandomforest
- Image-based classifiers @alvarezlopez2023gspynettreesignalvsglitchclassifiergravitationalwave
- Cross-correlation between detectors

---

## Global Detector Network

- LIGO (United States)
- Virgo (Europe)
- KAGRA (Japan)

True gravitational waves:
- Appear in multiple detectors
- Have consistent timing and waveform

---

## Citizen Science: Gravity Spy

- Crowd-sourced glitch classification
- Combines:
  - Human pattern recognition
  - Machine learning
- Improves detection reliability and efficiency

---

## Key Takeaways

- Gravitational waves open a new window on the universe
- LIGO measures extraordinarily tiny spacetime distortions
- Noise makes detection a major classification challenge
- Machine learning and citizen science are essential tools
